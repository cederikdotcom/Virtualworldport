# VirtualWorldPort

## About

VirtualWorldPort is an open protocol and infrastructure for connecting virtual worlds across different platforms and technologies. Our mission is to create a seamless travel experience between virtual destinations, regardless of their underlying technology.

## Core Components

### 1. DNS Protocol for Virtual Worlds

We've extended the traditional DNS protocol with additional fields to support virtual world discovery:
- Platform identifier (Web, Horizon Worlds, Somnium Space, etc.)
- Client link retrieval endpoint
- World metadata

This allows for consistent addressing and discovery of virtual destinations across the metaverse.

### 2. Digital Identity System

Our passport-inspired identity system facilitates secure travel between virtual worlds:
- Verifiable credentials for travelers
- Permission management for destinations
- Privacy-preserving identity verification
- Cross-platform authentication

### 3. Interoperable Monetary System

A standardized framework for financial transactions within and between virtual worlds:
- Currency exchange protocol
- Micropayment support
- Virtual asset transfer standards
- Support for both traditional and cryptocurrency payments

## Open Source Model

VirtualWorldPort follows a dual-licensing approach:

- **VirtualWorldPort.org**: Home of our open standards and reference implementations. All core protocols are freely available under open source licenses.

- **VirtualWorldPort.com**: Premium hosted services for commercial implementations, with 10% of revenue supporting the ongoing development of the open standards (following the Moodle sustainability model).

## Vision

We envision a future where:
- Any virtual world can easily join the network with minimal integration effort
- Users can seamlessly travel between worlds while maintaining their identity and assets
- Curated virtual travel agencies emerge to help users discover new experiences
- Standards evolve through community collaboration and real-world implementation
